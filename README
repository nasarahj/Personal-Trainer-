# AI Personal Trainer – Agentic LLM Application

Public URL - https://5c0627528fdb19179d.gradio.live

This project is an agent-based AI personal trainer built using Python, LangChain, and Gradio.  
It demonstrates modern applied AI system design by combining large language models with persistent memory, deterministic tools, and structured outputs.

The system generates personalized, safety-aware workout plans and adapts its responses based on user context such as injuries or preferences.
